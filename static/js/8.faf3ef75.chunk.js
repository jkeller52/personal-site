I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI). \n\n# Some history\n\n- My very first game console was the Nintendo Gamecube in 2007. Super Smash Bros Melee, LEGO Star Wars, and Super Monkey Ball 2 were my introduction to games. I was 9. \n\n- Runescape shortly followed. My parents' entry level desktop computer became my campground. My Mom triumphantly declared I would \"do something with computers\" when I got older. She wasn't wrong.\n\n- At 10, I built my first website using Moonfruit, a now-defunct service that hosted Wordpress-Like website templates. This website allowed me to get around the school firewall by embedding my favorite browser-based Flash games on the website (which wasn't blacklisted by the school network, like other popular game hosts)\n\n- At 11, I got a Playstation 3 and became interested in recording & editing my gameplay, exposing me to media software inclduing Sony Vegas 10, Camtasia and Adobe Photoshop\n\n- From 14-17 I played lots of video games on my Xbox 360, and later Xbox One. Destiny 1 was a favorite. The intense teamwork choreography required in the 'raid' gamemodes was fascinating. \n\n- Around 17 I got into modifying my first car, a 2006 Accord. With help from a friend, I refurbished all four wheels using a dremel tool, mineral spirits, wet-sanding, and primer/paint. I also installed a bluetooth stereo and soldered wires for the first time.\n\n- Towards the end of high school, I became interested in applying concepts from psychology to create better technology. This led me to pursue a degree in Psychology at Ohio State\n\n- Halfway through my first year of Undergrad, I discovered the Cognitive Systems Engineering Lab at OSU, drastically altering my academic path\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n======\n\n\n![AstrobeeGif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70432484/124196130-c7b03f00-da99-11eb-9cb5-bb6b99b4f72a.gif)\n  <img align=\"center\">\n  \n  *A Gazebo simulation of NASA's Astrobee robot is being explored as a testbed for studying human-robot teamwork*\n\n\nBroadly, I'm interested in exploring the interactions of humans and machines within complex work. A goal of my efforts is amplify and extend the human capability to know, perceive, decide, plan, act and collaborate by integrating system functions with the cognitive processes they need to support. Shrewd engineering practices drawn from Cognitive Systems Engineering and Resilience Engineering can inform the creation of sociotechnical systems that best promote these capabilities.\n\nHere are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:\n- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies\n- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals\n- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility\n\nMy interest in computational modeling and simulation relates directly to these pursuits, as a computational framework offers a low-overhead testbed for analyzing tradeoffs and complexities within work, provided ample care is taken in creating an ecologically valid representation of the work environment at hand. \n\nEmerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. \n\n\nRobust, resilient, and decentralized human-robot systems will pave the way towards advanced operations within distributed teams, facilitating the ablity to dynamically delegate authority, responsibility, and taskloads to other agents in the midst of rapidly shifting demands common in uncertain and complex environments. \n\n\n<figure>\n  <img align=\"center\">\n  <img src='/images/Artemis.png' alt=\"NASA Artemis Concept Art\">\n  <figcaption> This concept art from NASA shows astronauts working in close proximity with robotic agents. The precise details of how they work together are one example of my research interests. How many robots should assist an astronaut performing surface EVA tasks? How is control handed off between astronauts? What is the authority delegated to the robot to make decisions based on software rules and sensor inputs?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nRecent Conference Papers\n======\n### October 2021\n[Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.

I was unstoppable.\n\n- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.\n\n- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.\n\n- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.\n\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.\n\n- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.\n\n- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.\n\n- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Skiing\n- Sailing and the sea\n- Space\n- Summer\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/mdangelo)\n- Colored pencils ([Faber-Castell Polychromos](https://www.faber-castell.com/products/art-and-graphic/polychromos))\n- Podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n- [Photography](https://instagram.com/dangelosaurus)\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Buffalo, New York. I have since lived in Palo Alto, Mountain View, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York.\n- I've been to ~ 50 countries, some of which I have forgotten, and many of which I would like to revisit.\n- In 2016, I visited: Canada, Ethiopia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Italy, Romania, Sweden, Norway, Svalbard, Panama, Costa Rica, Uganda, Japan, and the UAE, mostly in that order.\n- In 2017, I visited: Canada, Japan, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, the U.K., Spain, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Ethiopia, and Luxembourg.\n- In 2018, I visited: Canada, France, Italy, Israel, and the U.K.\n- In 2019, I visited: Canada, England, France, and Switzerland.\n- In 2020, I barely traveled 20 blocks.
