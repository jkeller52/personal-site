This sparked interest in writing a research paper based on\ninformation collected in interviews. The paper applies a transdisciplinary approach, providing background and\ncontext on autonomous flight safety systems before identifying key assumptions and engineering tradeoffs in its design.\n\nRecommended Citation:\n* Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.

Drawing from literature'\nin resilience engineering, human-automation interaction, and cognitive systems engineering, this paper provides'\na theoretical exploration of the use of computational modeling and simulation to analyze resilience in HMTs.'\nFindings from literature are summarized in a set of requirements that highlight key aspects of resilience in'\nHMTs that need to be accounted for in future modeling and evaluation efforts.',  \n\nRecommended Citation:\n* Keller, J., & IJtsma, M.

My current interest is in JavaScript frameworks like React.js, Node.js, p5.js, and three.js. What's most impressive to me is the possibilities of using React.js libraries like framer-motion to achieve stunning visual effects. Having some background in visual analytics and perceptual psychology, I see tremendous fun (and opportunity) in designing salient, satisfying visual effects using React components. In my spare time, I often watch YouTube videos on the subject, learning piece by piece how I can create my own stunning webpage. \n\n### [Website Version 1](https://jkeller52.github.io)\n- v1 of my website was built using a Jekyll template called Minimal Mistakes, following documentation from the AcademicPages GitHub template. I found it very satisfying to slowly learn the skills required to publish my site, and was appreciative of the simple directory structure that enabled me to effortlessly locate content and manipulate it as desired. The page relies heavily on pre-packaged HTML/CSS, and had low overhead other than content management and configuration with deploying through GitHub Pages.\n\n### [Website 2 (this site)](https://jacobkeller.io)\n- This version of the site is based in React, adapted from mldangelo's [personal-site](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site) template on GitHub.\n- This rendition was a definitive upgrade from the GH Pages, Jekyll-based site I had been using previously. With that upgrade in performance and aesthetics came a sharp learning curve with JavaScript, React, and web hosting.\n\n### Website v3 (coming soon)\n- The third version of my website is intended to be a complete overhaul. I want to build a React-based page from the ground up, using aesthetically pleasing framer-motion effects to make my website an experience that's enjoyable to play around with\n- Fun Fact: I created my first website in the fourth grade so I could play flash games on school computers. Although the school network's firewall was robust enough to block popular game websites like addictinggames, miniclip and newgrounds, flash games were embeddable into any page in simple HTML, which you could copy and paste directly from the sites that hosted them. Though my MoonFruit site wasn't glamorous, it sure was functional for my classmates and I at the time (an aside: if you're unfamiliar with flash games, I'd recommend the humorous and language-NSFW YouTube Video [Flash Games Mattered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA&t=401s).\n\n## Custom PC Build\nYou can read about my March 2020 PC build [here](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/03/pcbuild)\n\n\n## Astrophotography\nGallery coming soon!\n",renderers:{Link:l},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
