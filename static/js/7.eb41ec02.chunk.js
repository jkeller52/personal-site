I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI). I'm currently a graduate student and researcher pursuing a Master's in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Ohio State.\n\nThis page has more information about my personal and professional interests.\n\nI'm interested in a wide range of DIY projects, including woodworking, electronics, and computer software & hardware. I especially like projects which draw elements from each.\n\n\n\n## Work Interests\n\nI'm interested in researching and developing technology enabling human-robot teamwork during future manned space exploration missions. In large part, this means understanding engineering tradeoffs surrounding automation with complex, mission-critical systems. \n\nHere are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:\n- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies\n- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals\n- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility\n\n\n\n## Future Research and Broader Contributions\nMy interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. \n\nEmerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf)\n\nIn general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. \n\n## Publications:\n\n* [Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
