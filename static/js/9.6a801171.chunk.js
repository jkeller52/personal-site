These emerging methods to simulate the dynamics of work enable iterative development and testing cycles that culminate in systems which exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, systematic, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approaches are necessary to support the introduction of novel technology in complex and unforgiving work environments. No amount of normative planning will result in a perfectly robust or infallible system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-adaptive systems is necessary.\n\n\n\n## Recent Works\n\n* [Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
