In general, methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approaches will necessary to support teamwork in complex environments where technology. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. \n\n\n\nRecent Conference Papers\n======\n### October 2021\n[Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
