I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI). I'm currently a graduate student and researcher pursuing a Master's in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Ohio State.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    This page has more information about my personal and professional interests.\n</p> \n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    I'm interested in a wide range of DIY projects, including woodworking, electronics, and computer software & hardware. I especially like projects which draw elements from each.\n</p>\n\n\n## Personal Interests\n\n### Programming\n\t* I'm almost entirely a self-taught programmer, and use mostly Python, JS, and bash. My current interest is in JavaScript frameworks like React.js, Node.js, p5.js, and three.js. What's most impressive to me is the possibilities of using React.js libraries like framer-motion to achieve stunning visual effects. Having some background in visual analytics and perceptual psychology, I see tremendous fun (and opportunity) in designing salient, satisfying visual effects using React components. In my spare time, I often watch YouTube videos on the subject, learning piece by piece how I can create my own stunning webpage. \n\nWebsite \n\n*Both renditions of my website are built upon prexisting templates which I modified to suit my needs and desired style.*\n\n[Website Version 1](https://jkeller52.github.io)\n- v1 of my website was built using a Jekyll template called Minimal Mistakes, following documentation from the AcademicPages GitHub template. I found it very satisfying to slowly learn the skills required to publish my site, and was appreciative of the simple directory structure that enabled me to effortlessly locate content and manipulate it as desired. The page relies heavily on pre-packaged HTML/CSS, and had low overhead other than content management and configuration with deploying through GitHub Pages.\n\n[Website 2 (this site)](https://jacobkeller.io)\n- This version of the site is based in React, adapted from mldangelo's [personal-site](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site) template on GitHub.\n- This rendition was a definitive upgrade from the GH Pages, Jekyll-based site I had been using previously. With that upgrade in performance and aesthetics came a sharp learning curve with JavaScript, React, and web hosting.\n\n* Website v3 (coming soon)\n\t- The third version of my website is intended to be a complete overhaul. I want to build a React-based page from the ground up, using aesthetically pleasing framer-motion effects to make my website an experience that's enjoyable to play around with\n\t* Fun Fact: I created my first website in the fourth grade so I could play flash games on school computers. Although the school network's firewall was robust enough to block popular game websites like addictinggames, miniclip and newgrounds, flash games were embeddable into any page in simple HTML, which you could copy and paste directly from the sites that hosted them. Though my MoonFruit site wasn't glamorous, it sure was functional for my classmates and I at the time (an aside: if you're unfamiliar with flash games, I'd recommend the humorous and semi-NSFW YouTube Video [Flash Games Mattered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA&t=401s)).\n\n### Custom PC Build\nYou can read about my PC build [here](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/03/pcbuild)\n\n### Astrophotography\nClick [here](https://jacobkeller.io/projects)\n\n# Work Interests\n\nI'm interested in researching and developing technology enabling human-robot teamwork during future manned space exploration missions. In large part, this means understanding engineering tradeoffs surrounding automation with complex, mission-critical systems. \n\nHere are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:\n- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies\n- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals\n- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility\n\n\n\n## Future Research and Broader Contributions\nMy interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. \n\nEmerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf)\n\nIn general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. \n\nMy Publications:\n\n[Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
