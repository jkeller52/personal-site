I'm a graduate student and researcher pursuing a Master's in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Ohio State.\n\nI'm interested in a wide range of projects and application areas including resilience engineering, web development, human-robot interaction, and socioeconomics. I especially like interdiscipinary pursuits, such as developing embedded systems or using principles from psychology and systems engineering to support interaction design goals.\n\n## Work Interests\n\nI'm interested in developing more resilient sociotechnical systems through understanding and mitigating tradeoffs assocaited with automated technologies. \n\n\nI'm interested in automated technologies as they relate to human practitioners within expert domains. \n\nI hold particular interest in advancing technology enabling human-robot teamwork during future manned space exploration missions. In large part, this means understanding engineering tradeoffs surrounding automation within complex, safety-critical systems. \n\nHere are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:\n- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies\n- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals\n- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility\n\n\n\n## Future Research and Broader Contributions\nMy interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. \n\nEmerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf)\n\nIn general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. \n\n## Publications:\n\n* [Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
