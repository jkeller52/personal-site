I bring an interdisciplinary approach to the development of novel sociotechnical systems, aligning the needs of expert practitioners and the capabilities at their disposal.\n\n\nMy experiences have trained me in identifying approaches to improve decision-making and coordination/teamwork processes in domains including:\n- Space mission technology enabling future earth independence during planetary exploration (xEVA)\n- System-level implications and tradeoffs of automating flight termination systems for space launches\n- Rapid coordination and collaboration by DevOps engineers during critical digital service outages\n- Intelligence analyst data overload conditions when processing large amounts of SIGINT, OSINT, IMINT\n- Nuclear micro-reactor end-user transportation and deployment Concept of Operations\n\n\nFollowing the completion of my Master's degree in Spring 2023, I am pursuing full-time employment. You can find more about my professional experiences and competencies below:  \n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n## Academic Work\n- Graduate Research Associate, Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State University (2020-Present)\n- Undergraduate Research Assistant, Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State University (2018-2020)\n- Bachelor of Science in Human Systems Integration, Ohio State University, 2020\n\n## Industry Experience\nI have internship experience applying my research and academic background in various domains including:\n- Working at NASA Johnson Space Center to develop Augmented Reality (AR) technology for Artemis exploration extravehicular activity (xEVA)\n- Deveoping decision-support software for intelligence analysts facing data overload (2 summers)\n- Contributing to end-user deployment Concept of Operations for novel energy technology system\n\n## Interests\n* Space Exploration\n* Applied Cognitive Psychology\n* Human-Machine Teamwork\n* Solving wicked problems involving people and technology\n* Web development\n\n## Select Publications:\n\n* [Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
