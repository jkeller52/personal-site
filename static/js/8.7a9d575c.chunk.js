I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI).\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Interests\n======\nProfessionally, I'm interested in researching and developing technology enabling human-robot teamwork during future manned space exploration missions. More broadly, I'm interested in understanding and supporting humans within complex work. \n\n![AstrobeeGif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70432484/124196130-c7b03f00-da99-11eb-9cb5-bb6b99b4f72a.gif)\n  <img align=\"center\">\n  \n  *A Gazebo simulation of NASA's Astrobee robot is being explored as a testbed for studying human-robot teamwork*\n\nI'm very interested in understanding engineering tradeoffs surrounding automation with complex, mission-critical systems. \n\nHere are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:\n- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies\n- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals\n- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility\n\nMy interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. \n\nEmerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. \n\nMy Research Publications:\n[Keller, J., IJtsma, M., & Newton, E.
