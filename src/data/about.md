## Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm a systems engineer skilled in creating decision-support tools and operational concepts for complex, mission-critical work. I currently work for Jacobs as NASA Johnson Space Center

My professional experiences have trained me in identifying approaches to improve decision-making and coordination/teamwork processes in domains including manned space exploration decision-support, digital infrastructure systems, safety-critical energy technologies, intelligence analysis systems, spaceflight termination systems, and more.
