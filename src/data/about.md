## Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm an engineering graduate student and researcher interested in creating decision-support tools and operational concepts for complex, mission-critical work.

My professional experiences have trained me in identifying approaches to improve decision-making and coordination/teamwork processes in domains including digital infrastructure, safety-critical energy technology, intelligence analysis, spaceflight termination systems, and manned space exploration decision-support.
