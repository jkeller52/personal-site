# Intro
Hi, my name is Jacob Keller. I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI).


# Some history

- My very first game console was the Nintendo Gamecube in 2006. Super Smash Bros Melee, LEGO Star Wars, and Super Monkey Ball 2 were my introduction to games. I was 8. 

- Shortly after, I found myself camping out at my parents' entry level desktop computer became my campground. My Mom triumphantly declared I would "do something with computers" when I got older. She wasn't wrong.

- At 10, I built my first website using Moonfruit, a now-defunct service that hosted simple Wordpress-Like website templates. This website allowed me to get around the school firewall by embedding my favorite browser-based Flash games on the website (which wasn't blacklisted by the school network, like other popular game hosts)

- At 11, I got a Playstation 3 and became interested in recording & editing my gameplay, exposing me to media software inclduing Sony Vegas 10, Camtasia and Adobe Photoshop

- From 14-17 I played lots of video games on my Xbox 360, and later Xbox One. Destiny 1 was a favorite. The intense teamwork choreography required in the 'raid' gamemodes was fascinating. 

- Around 17 I got into modifying electronics in my first car, a 2006 Accord. With help from a friend, I refurbished all four wheels using a dremel, mineral spirits, wet-sanding, and primer/paint. I also installed a bluetooth stereo and soldered wires for the first time.

- Towards the end of high school, I became interested in applying concepts from psychology to create better technology. This led me to pursue a degree in psychology, with particular interest in human factors psychology

- Halfway through my first year of Undergrad, I discovered the Cognitive Systems Engineering Lab at OSU, drastically altering my academic path

- At 20, I created my own unique undergraduate degree curriculum, in Human Systems Integration, backed by faculty in the departments of Psychology and Integrated Systems Engineering

- At 22, I earned the first B.S. In Human Systems Integration to be awarded from Ohio State

- Now, at 23, I am working towards my Master's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering


# Fun facts

- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.
- I almost always have a sketchbook with me and a [01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen](https://www.sakuraofamerica.com/product/pigma-micron/).
- I can't locate every country on a map.
- I operate a [small angel fund](http://skepticalinvestments.biz/) with terrible returns.
- I break about 30 traffic laws on a [cruiser](https://landyachtz.com/boards/cruiser/), [onewheel](https://onewheel.com/products/xr), [bicycle](https://www.citibikenyc.com/), or [electric skateboard](https://boostedusa.com/collections/electric-skateboards/products/boosted-mini-x) every single day.

  *A Gazebo simulation of NASA's Astrobee robot is being explored as a testbed for studying human-robot teamwork*


Broadly, I'm interested in exploring the interactions of humans and machines within complex work.

Here are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:
- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies
- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals
- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility

My interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. 

Emerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary.
