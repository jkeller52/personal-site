### Intro
Hi, I'm Jacob Keller. I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI). I'm currently a graduate student and researcher pursuing a Master's in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Ohio State.

I'm interested in a wide range of projects and application areas. I'm recently becoming involved in woodworking and developing my own computer software & hardware. I especially like interdiscipinary pursuits, such as developing embedded systems or using principles from psychology and systems engineering to support interaction design goals.

## Work Interests

I'm interested in researching and developing technology enabling human-robot teamwork during future manned space exploration missions. In large part, this means understanding engineering tradeoffs surrounding automation within complex, mission-critical systems. 

Here are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:
- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies
- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals
- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility



## Future Research and Broader Contributions
My interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. 

Emerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf)

In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary.
