# Intro

My name is Jacob Keller. I grew up in Hebron, Kentucky, and graduated from Ohio State University in 2020 with my BS in [Human Systems Integration](https://jkeller52.github.io/posts/2021/07/HSI). Currently, I'm a Graduate Research Associate within the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering at Ohio State. My research interests include human-machine teaming, resilience engineering, and computational modeling.

I continuously update this website to reflect my most up-to-date thoughts and ideas about my work. You may find some rough patches here and there, as the site is always under construction.

  *A Gazebo simulation of NASA's Astrobee robot is being explored as a testbed for studying human-robot teamwork*


Broadly, I'm interested in exploring the interactions of humans and machines within complex work. A goal of my efforts is amplify and extend the human capability to know, perceive, decide, plan, act and collaborate by integrating system functions with the cognitive processes they need to support. Shrewd engineering practices drawn from Cognitive Systems Engineering and Resilience Engineering can inform the creation of sociotechnical systems that best promote these capabilities.

Here are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:
- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies
- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals
- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility

My interest in computational modeling and simulation relates directly to these pursuits, as a computational framework offers a low-overhead testbed for analyzing tradeoffs and complexities within work, provided ample care is taken in creating an ecologically valid representation of the work environment at hand. 

Emerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary. 


Robust, resilient, and decentralized human-robot systems will pave the way towards advanced operations within distributed teams, facilitating the ablity to dynamically delegate authority, responsibility, and taskloads to other agents in the midst of rapidly shifting demands common in uncertain and complex environments.

How many robots should assist an astronaut performing surface EVA tasks? How is control handed off between astronauts? What is the authority delegated to the robot to make decisions based on software rules and sensor inputs?</figcaption>

OLD TEXT

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.

- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.

- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.

- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
