## Intro
Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm an engineering graduate student and researcher interested in creating decision-support tools and operational concepts for complex, mission-critical work. I bring an interdisciplinary approach to the development of novel sociotechnical systems, aligning the needs of expert practitioners and the capabilities at their disposal.


My experiences have trained me in identifying approaches to improve decision-making and coordination/teamwork processes in domains including:
- Space mission technology enabling future earth independence during planetary exploration (xEVA)
- System-level implications and tradeoffs of automating flight termination systems for space launches
- Rapid coordination and collaboration by DevOps engineers during critical digital service outages
- Intelligence analyst data overload conditions when processing large amounts of SIGINT, OSINT, IMINT
- Nuclear micro-reactor end-user transportation and deployment Concept of Operations


Following the completion of my Master's degree in Spring 2023, I am pursuing full-time employment. You can find more about my professional experiences and competencies below:
