  *A Gazebo simulation of NASA's Astrobee robot is being explored as a testbed for studying human-robot teamwork*


Broadly, I'm interested in exploring the interactions of humans and machines within complex work.

Here are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:
- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies
- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals
- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility

My interest in computational modeling and simulation frameworks offer a low-overhead testbed to envision, verify, and validate concepts of operations before investing resources to mature them. 

Emerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore a paradigm shift towards designing modular, contextually-aware adaptive systems is necessary.
