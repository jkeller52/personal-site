My research focuses on the intersection of people, technology, and work, applying an [interdisciplinary approach](https://jacobkeller.io/about) to tackle wicked problems in complex, mission-critical work.

Here are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:
- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies
- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals
- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegations of authority and responsbility amongst teammates

My recent work has focused on developing technological capabilities supporting exploration extravehicular activity (xEVA) for planetary space operations. Examples of this include Augmented Reality aids for suited crewmembers during EVA, as well as missions system softwares enabling ground teams to coordinate and collaborate in real-time during EVA.
